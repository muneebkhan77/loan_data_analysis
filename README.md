# loan data analysis

The aim was to create a credit risk model to calculate the probability of default for all personal accounts in the bank.
I was assigned to take in raw dataset and prepare it for the models. I was provided with information about every feature and a set of instructions on how to clean and preprocess the data.Numpy was used to preprocess the raw dataset.
All categorical variables were quantified and when measuring credit worthiness we were risk averse and distrustful i.e in case of a missing value we assumed the worst
